- fixed bug in MARC::XMLWriter that was outputting all control field tags as 00z
  (thanks Ross Singer)

  marcxml namespace, which allows MARC::Record::to_xml to emit the namespace 
  for a single record.

v0.1.3  Tue Jan  2 12:56:36 EST 2007

  to_dublin_core on a MARC::Record returns a hash that has Dublin Core fields
  as the hash keys.

  namespace on collection element

  was found on an element (exposed by namespace changes).

v0.0.7  Mon Jan  2 21:39:28 CST 2006
- MARC::XMLWriter added
- removed encode/decode methods in MARC::MARC21 into MARC::Writer and 
  MARC::Reader respectively. This required pushing MARC21 specific constants

  to MARC::Constants

  possibly faulty offsets when the user needs them.

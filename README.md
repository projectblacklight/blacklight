Blacklight is an open source Solr user interface discovery platform.
You can use Blacklight to enable searching and browsing of your collections.
Blacklight uses the [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr) search engine
to search full text and/or metadata.  Blacklight has a highly
configurable Ruby on Rails front-end. Blacklight was originally developed at
the University of Virginia Library and is made public under an Apache 2.0 license.

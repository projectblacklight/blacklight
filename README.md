## Description

Blacklight is an open source Solr user interface discovery platform.
You can use Blacklight to enable searching and browsing of your collections.
Blacklight uses the [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr) search engine
to search full text and/or metadata.  Blacklight has a highly
configurable Ruby on Rails front-end. Blacklight was originally developed at
the University of Virginia Library and is made public under an Apache 2.0 license.

## Installation

Add Blacklight to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "blacklight"
```

Run the install generator which will copy over some initial templates, migrations, routes, and configuration:

```bash
rails generate blacklight:install
```

## Browser Compatibility

Blacklight assumes a modern browser with support for [Baseline 2023](https://web.dev/baseline/2023). This means we explicitly do not support Internet Explorer.

## Dependencies

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) 3.1+
* [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) 6.1+

Blacklight aims to support the currently [supported versions of Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/) and the [supported versions of Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/maintenance_policy.html).  We aim to keep our [test configuration](blob/main/.github/workflows/ruby.yml) up to date with these supported versions.

## Contributing Code

Code contributions are always welcome, instructions for contributing can be found at [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Configuring Apache Solr
You'll also want some information about how Blacklight expects [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr ) to run, which you can find in [Solr Configuration](https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/wiki/Solr-Configuration#solr-configuration)

## Building the javascript
The javascript includes some derivative combination files that are built at release time, that can be used by some javascript pipelines. The derivatives are placed at `app/assets/javascripts/blacklight`, and files there should not be edited by hand.

When any of the javascript components in the gem are changed, you may have to rebuild these derivative files.


1. [Install npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
1. run `bundle exec rake build:npm`
  (just runs `npm install` to download dependencies and `npm run prepare` to build the bundle)


## Releasing versions

You always need to release both the rubygem and npm package simultaneously. For more information, see [wiki](https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/wiki/How-to-release-a-version)

Summary of technical steps:

1. Make sure `./package.json` and  `./VERSION` files have correct and matching versions.
1. Release ruby gem with `bundle exec rake release`
1. Release npm package
  1. Build derivative products included in release with `bundle exec rake build:npm`
  1. Publish with `npm publish`.



## Using the javascript
Blacklight ships with Javascript that can be compiled either by Webpacker or by
Sprockets. To use Webpacker see the directions at https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/wiki/Using-Webpacker-to-compile-javascript-assets

If you prefer to use Sprockets, simply run the install generator, which will run the assets generator. For details see https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/wiki/Using-Sprockets-to-compile-javascript-assets

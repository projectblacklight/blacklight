# Blacklight customization of the Rake tasks that come with rspec-2, to run
# specs located in alternate location (inside BL plugin), and to provide
# rake tasks for jetty/solr wrapping. 
#
# Same tasks as in ordinary rspec, but prefixed with blacklight:. 
#
# rspec2 keeps it's rake tasks inside it's own code, it doesn't generate them. 
# We had to copy them from there and modify, may have to be done again
# if rspec2 changes a lot, but this code looks relatively cleanish.

# Theming Blacklight

## Bootswatches

The Blacklight 4.x styling is [[Twitter Bootstrap|http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap]] based. While there is some Blacklight-specific code for handling layouts and positions, most (if not all) the "styling" (colors, fonts, etc) are handled by Bootstrap.

There are many sources for Bootstrap themes. We'll look at bootswatches because they are fairly painless to integrate into a Rails application.

First, add the [[bootswatch-rails gem|https://github.com/maxim/bootswatch-rails]]  to your Gemfile (and run ```bundle install```):

```ruby
gem 'bootswatch-rails'
```

This will give you the set of themes from [[http://bootswatch.com/]], converted to SASS and exposed to the Rails asset pipeline. 

Out of the box, your application's blacklight stylesheet (generated by default to ```app/assets/stylesheets/blacklight.css.scss```) looks something like:

```css
@import 'bootstrap';
@import 'bootstrap-responsive';

@import 'blacklight/blacklight';
```

To add the one of the bootswatch themes ('cerulean' in this example):

```css
@import "bootswatch/cerulean/variables";

@import "bootstrap";
@import "bootstrap-responsive";

@import "bootswatch/cerulean/bootswatch";

@import 'blacklight/blacklight'
```

The [[bootswatch-rails|https://github.com/maxim/bootswatch-rails]] documentation provides similar directions, a list of available out-of-the-box themes, and more.

> As of this writing, not all bootswatch-rails themes seem to be bootstrap 2.1.x compatible, or do weird things to the Blacklight navbar, etc. Your milage may vary.

## Developing a Customized "Local" Theme

In most cases, you will want to develop your own theme within your Blacklight app, outside of the Bootswatch gem.  To do this, you can do the following in your ```app/assets/stylesheets``` directory:

1. create your own _variables.scss and _bootswatch.scss files in stylesheets/ (easiest way to do this is to copy those files from the [[bootstrap-sass project|https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/tree/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap]] or an existing theme and customize from there)
2. change application.css to application.css.scss 
3. add the import statements given in the above "theming" example to application.css.scss
4. delete blacklight.css.scss

So, your application.css.scss should look like this:
```css
@import "variables";

@import "bootstrap";
@import "bootstrap-responsive";

@import "bootswatch";

@import 'blacklight/blacklight'
```

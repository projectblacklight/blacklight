# Preconference Planning

"Half-Day [Morning]"
Contact: Chris Beer, Stanford University, cabeer@stanford.edu
TA: Bess Sadler, Stanford University, bess@stanford.edu
This session will be walk-through of the architecture of Blacklight, the community, and an introduction to building a Blacklight-based application. Each participant will have the opportunity to build a simple Blacklight application, and make basic customizations, while using a test-driven approach.
For more information about Blacklight see our wiki ( http://projectblacklight.org/ ) and our GitHub repo ( https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight ). We will also send out some brief instructions beforehand for those that would like to setup their environments to follow along and get Blacklight up and running on their local machines.

"Half-Day [Afternoon]"
This afternoon hackfest is both a follow-on to the Intro to Blacklight morning session to continue building Blacklight-based applications, and also an opportunity for existing Blacklight contributors and members of the Blacklight community to exchange common patterns and approaches into reusable gems or incorporate customizations into Blacklight itself.
For more information about Blacklight see our wiki ( http://projectblacklight.org/ ) and our GitHub repo ( https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight ).

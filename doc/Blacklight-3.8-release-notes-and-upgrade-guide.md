This is primarily a release to bring the Blacklight 3.x line up to feature-parity with the upcoming bootstrap release, and contains backports of features and bugfixes from the bootstrap work.

Highlights include:

- pulling bookmark data from solr (rather than a database-backed title cache)
- clean-up of some pagination code 
- pruning dead code around folders (removed in the 3.7 release)

## Introduction

Blacklight is an open source, Ruby on Rails engine/gem that provides a discovery interface for  [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr). Blacklight provides a basic user interface for searching a Solr index, and provides search box, facet constraints, stable document urls, etc., all of which is customizable via Rails (templating) mechanisms.  Blacklight accommodates heterogeneous data, allowing different information displays for different types of objects. 

Some other features include:

* Stable URLs for search and record pages allow users to bookmark, share, and save search queries for later access
* Every Blacklight search provides RSS and Atom Responses of search results
* For certain types of solr documents, an OpenURL/Z39.88 COinS object is embedded in each document, which allows plugins like Zotero to easily extract data from the page.
* Blacklight supports OpenSearch, a collection of simple formats for the sharing of search results.
* Faceted searching
* Search queries can be targeted at specific sets of fields
* Results sorting
* Tools for exporting records to Refworks or Endnote, sending records via Email or SMS, or as a formatted citation.

A [demo application](http://demo.projectblacklight.org) uses the latest version of Blacklight to display a basic library catalog.

> NOTE: This wiki provides developer documentation for the latest Blacklight release. For documentation of older releases, see the end of this page.
